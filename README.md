# Cloud Computing Project

Cloud computing â€“ Following on from the EDT project, our team members worked on the MVP and hypothesis statement to come up with a plan for 
developing the MVP using cloud technologies.

Our team drafted the Architecture diagram, and touched on the topics for Garage methodology (DevOps+EDT), Cloud technologies and Data, 
Security, AI + Multichannel (my primary scope).
